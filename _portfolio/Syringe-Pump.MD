# Introduction
Syringe pumps are motor-driven devices capable of delivering fluids across a wide range of flow rates, typically operating through a motor turning a lead screw. A nut coupled to the syringe's plunger travels along this screw, and as the screw rotates, the plunger is pushed forward, ejecting a proportional volume of liquid. The key benefits include maintaining sterility with minimal cross-contamination when swapping syringes, the ability to pump highly viscous fluids, high accuracy, and non-pulsatile flow. These features make them valuable in laboratory settings for microfluidic devices and medical facilities for administering therapeutics and nutrients. However, their main limitation is the finite volume of the syringe, which cannot recirculate fluid or draw from a larger reservoir, meaning delivery stops when the syringe is empty. High-end models often alert staff when the syringe is nearing empty. Consequently, designing, 3D printing, and programming a syringe pump is a cost-effective alternative
